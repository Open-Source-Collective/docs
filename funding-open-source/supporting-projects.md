# Supporting Projects

### How to give

There are many ways you (or your company) can support the open source projects hosted by Open Source Collective:

* [Credit Card, PayPal, or Bank Transfer](supporting-projects.md#giving-via-credit-card-paypal-or-bank-transfer)
* [Crypto](https://blog.opencollective.com/support-open-source-software-using-crypto/)
* [Stock](https://openstocks.co)&#x20;
* [Company-issued gift cards](https://opencollective.com/gift-cards)
* GitHub Sponsors

On behalf of our collectives, thank you for your support! We highly value all of our contributors. If there is anything you need as a donor, please [reach out](../about/contact.md).

### Tax deductibility and nonprofit status <a href="#docs-internal-guid-c3047733-7fff-4c7d-570a-2ba58ec9d0c1" id="docs-internal-guid-c3047733-7fff-4c7d-570a-2ba58ec9d0c1"></a>

Contributions to Collectives hosted by the Open Source Collective are not tax deductible, as we are a 501(c)(6) nonprofit, not a charity 501(c)(3).

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are a US-based project with an explicitly charitable mission, and you wish to qualify for charity grants and tax-deductible donations, you may wish to apply to[ Open Collective Foundation](http://opencollective.com/foundation).

### Giving via Credit Card, PayPal, or Bank Transfer

To contribute to an initiative online on the Open Collective platform via Credit Card, PayPal, or Bank Transfer (a.k.a. ACH or wire transfer), please see [this overview of the process](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/financial-contributors/payments).

Once you choose to contribute from the collective’s profile, our platform will guide you through the rest of the process, including choosing between credit card, PayPal, and electronic bank transfer (i.e., ACH or wire).

{% hint style="info" %}
The fastest way to have access to funds is through **Card/PayPal donations** made directly on the Open Collective Platform.

**Bank transfers (e.g. ACH, wire)** are done manually - this means it takes the funds a couple of days to clear (due to bank processing times), and then the allocation of the funds requires additional actions from OSC.  **It is important to allow for a few days (minimum 3 business days) when awaiting donations made via bank transfer.**
{% endhint %}

#### **Bank Transfers**

If you select to make a contribution via bank transfer, you will automatically be given bank transfer instructions, on screen and by email, along with a unique reference ID code.

You must include the unique ID code as a reference with your bank transfer, so we can match up the transaction.

Once the money has arrived, we will confirm, then the amount will be credited to the initiative’s balance and you will automatically receive a receipt.‌

When you arrange the transfer, if you have the option of sending an email notification for the transaction, please use [our email](../about/contact.md).&#x20;

#### **Giving Anonymously**

If you would like your contribution to be partially or fully anonymous, see our documentation on incognito and [guest](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/financial-contributors/guest-contributions) contributions.

#### **Secure Contributions**

Open Source Collective doesn't store donor credit card numbers on our servers. Instead, we partner with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/security/stripe), a secure solution that is widely adopted by the industry, to process one-time and recurring contributions.

#### Check Donations

Open Source Collective does not usually accept check donations. If that is option, and you _absolutely cannot_ give via electronic bank transfer, please [contact us](../about/contact.md).&#x20;
