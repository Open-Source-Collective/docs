# Blog Bounties

We have a standing offer to all Collectives under the OSC umbrella to write a guest post for our blog about your project and how you're using Open Collective. We will contribute $100 to your Collective if you submit a guest post. If you'd like to do this, [get in touch](mailto:hello@oscollective.org).
