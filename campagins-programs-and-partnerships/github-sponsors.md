### Registering your Collective with GitHub Sponsors

To register your project for GitHub Sponsors you will need:&#x20;

* A **GitHub organization** (not an individual user account) that hosts your repository/repositories on GitHub. You can create a GitHub organization by following [this guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch).
* A[ Collective](https://opencollective.com/opensource/apply) on the Open Collective platform for your open source project. You will need to use Open Source Collective as your fiscal host. [Read more about applying to OSC here.](../getting-started/how-to-apply/)&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
_Organizations on Open Collective are not the same as Organizations on GitHub. You must create a **Collective** in order to manage your project's finances on Open Collective._
{% endhint %}

To register for GitHub Sponsors follow these steps:

* Visit [github.com/sponsors](http://github.com/sponsors) and sign your Github organization up for the Sponsors waitlist:\
  \
  \- Select: "This organization is using a fiscal host" and select _Open Source Collective_ from the menu.\
  \
  \- Add your Collective's URL to the 'Fiscal host project profile URL' box for example: [https://opencollective.com/babel](https://opencollective.com/babel)

![Be sure to select 'Open Source Collective' from the dropdown.](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2021-12-29 at 13.15.42.png>)

* Click Join Waitlist.&#x20;

GitHub staff will review your application, and you'll be notified when you can proceed to the next step.

{% hint style="info" %}
Open Source Collective acts as your legal and financial home. You do not need to enter your own Stripe account or business information.\
\
If you reach this step please contact [support@opencollective.com](mailto:suport@opnollec) and we will amend your application with GitHub.

### Receiving Financial Contributions

GitHub processes payments to GitHub Sponsors participants on a monthly basis. We allocate these payments when we receive them, **typically on the 27th of each month**.

{% hint style="success" %}
Funds will be automatically added to Collectives' balance, minus our 10% administration fee, at the end of each month. 'GitHub Sponsors' will be indicated as the source of the funds. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

If you have not received a payment that you expected by the end of the month please [contact our support team](../about/contact.md).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will we receive our contributions from GitHub Sponsors?

We process payouts from GitHub on a monthly basis, typically on the 27th of the month.&#x20;

### What fees will be charged?

The standard Open Collective and Open Source Collective fees apply to funds raised via GitHub Sponsors: 10%. GitHub does not charge a fee.

### Should I create an Organization or a Collective?

Confusingly, GitHub and Open Collective use the word "organization" to mean two different things.

* **On GitHub, you need to create an Organization** to use Sponsors for your project.
* **On Open Collective, you need to create a Collective** for your project.
  * Organizations on Open Collective are a different profile type, for companies who sponsor open source projects, i.e. designed for paying money out, not accepting money like Collectives.
