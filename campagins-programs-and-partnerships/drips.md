# Drips

{% hint style="success" %}
If you'd like to support an Open Source community through Drips, direct them to this page.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Supporting a project through Drips

Open Source Collective work with our member projects to ensure that any project registered on Drips, that uses Open Collective to manage its money, will receive that money automatically on a periodic basis.&#x20;

Simply sponsor the project on Drips, and we'll do the rest.&#x20;

### Claiming your Collective with Drips

Open Source Collective can Claim a project on your behalf. Before requesting we claim a project you will need:

* A **GitHub organization** (not an individual user account) that hosts your repository/repositories on GitHub. You can create a GitHub organization by following [this guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch).
* A[ Collective](https://opencollective.com/opensource/apply) on the Open Collective platform for your open source project. You will need to use Open Source Collective as your fiscal host. [Read more about applying to OSC here.](../getting-started/how-to-apply/)&#x20;
* Commit access to the corresponding code repository.
* Optional: A hardware or software wallet that supports the Ethereum network.

Once you have been accepted to Open Source Collective contact us at [hello@oscollective.org](mailto:hello@oscollective.org) to organise an onboarding call.
{% endhint %}

During our onboarding process, we will:

* Provide a quick overview of how Drips works.&#x20;
* Determine whether you would like to use a multi-signature wallet, or have Open Source Collective generate and own a wallet for your project. &#x20;
* Decide on an amount to send to your Collective, to other maintainers directly and to other projects.&#x20;

### Using Drips with a Safe Wallet

Drips can be used through a multi-signature Safe wallet in much the same way Drips is used with an individual wallet. Transactions are 'proposed' to the Safe Wallet for signing by the Drips application, and executed once the threshold has been reached and execution costs paid.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that gas fees will be due on transactions written to the Ethereum blockchain; this includes claiming a project on Drips, modifying splits, and collecting funds. Open Source Collective will pay for and charge these costs back to the Collective if needed.&#x20;

### Receiving Financial Contributions

Drips facilitates the constant stream of any ERC-20 token to any number of projects, represented by a GitHub repository. Open Source Collective initiates the collection of allocated funds on a periodic basis (typically monthly) based on the amounts received in order to reduce transaction costs.&#x20;

Funds will be added to the Collectives' balance, minus our 10% administration fee, on a periodic basis. Drips will be indicated as the source of the funds.  A project administrator may be required to sign the document containing the funds collected from Drips.&#x20;
