# Drips

{% hint style="success" %}
If you'd like to support an Open Source community through Drips, direct them to this page.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Supporting a project through Drips

Open Source Collective work with our member projects to ensure that any project registered on Drips, that uses Open Collective to manage its money, will receive that money automatically on a periodic basis.&#x20;

Simply sponsor the project on Drips, and we'll do the rest.&#x20;

### Registering your Collective with Drips

To register your project on Drips you will need:&#x20;

* A **GitHub organization** (not an individual user account) that hosts your repository/repositories on GitHub. You can create a GitHub organization by following [this guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch).
* A[ Collective](https://opencollective.com/opensource/apply) on the Open Collective platform for your open source project. You will need to use Open Source Collective as your fiscal host. [Read more about applying to OSC here.](../getting-started/how-to-apply/)&#x20;
* A hardware or software wallet that supports the Ethereum network

{% hint style="success" %}
Once you have been accepted to Open Source Collective and created a wallet, contact us at [hello@oscollective.org](mailto:hello@oscollective.org) to organise an onboarding call.
{% endhint %}

During our onboarding process, we will:

* setup a mutli-signature wallet with Safe on behalf of your project
* add at least two maintainers as signers, alongside our own account
* use the Safe wallet address to claim your project on drips (you will need to commit access to write a configuration file to the root of your repository)&#x20;

From there, you can use Drips to decide how much of the funds received by your project should be reallocated to projects you depend upon and which projects you wish to allocate those funds to.&#x20;

### Using Drips with a Safe Wallet

Drips can be used through a multi-signature Safe wallet in much the same way Drips is used with an individual wallet.&#x20;

Transactions are 'proposed' to the Safe Wallet for signing by the Drips application, and executed once the threshold has been reached and execution costs paid.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that gas fees will be due on transactions written to the Ethereum blockchain, this includes claiming a project on Drips, modifying splits, and collecting funds. Open Source Collective will pay for and charge back these costs if needed.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Receiving Financial Contributions

Drips facilitates the constant stream of any ERC-20 token to any number of projects, represented by a GitHub repository. Open Source Collective initiates the collection of allocated funds on a periodic basis (typically monthly) based on the amounts received in order to reduce transaction costs.&#x20;

Funds will be added to the Collectives' balance, minus our 10% administration fee, on a periodic basis. 'Drips' will be indicated as the source of the funds.  A project administrator will be required to sign the collection of funds from Drips.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Without a signature from at least one other maintainer Open Source Collective will not be able to collect funds and allocate them to your project.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
