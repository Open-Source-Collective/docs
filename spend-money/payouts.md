# Payouts

To withdraw money from your Collective balance, [submit an expense](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/submitting-expenses).

OSC processes expenses twice a week. If you have any issues with a specific expense, the best way to get an answer is to post a comment on that expense page.
