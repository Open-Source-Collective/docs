# What is OSC?

Open Source Collective is a nonprofit working for the common interests of those who create and use open-source software, bringing open source philosophy and values to financial management. As a nonprofit fiscal host (a.k.a. fiscal sponsor or foundation), we provide **financial and legal infrastructure** for **thousands of open source projects**. We’re the ‘API' between the world of open source communities and the world of accounting and invoices.

### For Open Source Communities

## How we Think

As a nonprofit fiscal host (a.k.a. fiscal sponsor or foundation), we provide the **financial and legal infrastructure** for **thousands of open source projects**. For Maintainers

### People are more important than code

Open source software is a byproduct of active communities working toward a common goal. We prioritize the needs of people first.&#x20;

### One size does not fit all

Open Source Collective does not impose a structure, a process or a statute on you and your community.&#x20;

### Strength lies in _community_

That said, we do believe that strength comes from broad and diverse community-centered approaches. We encourage members to think about distributing their responsibilities and building communities.&#x20;

* Manage all your open source support in a single place, with Open Source Collective acting as a single ‘supplier’ to your organization
* Support projects instantly on a one-time or recurring basis using a credit card, PayPal, or electronic bank transfer
* Hold funds with us to cover your contributions throughout the year
* Issue gift cards to your staff, which they can then use to contribute on behalf of your organization

### Solving problems _together_

We believe that we can address many of the problems we face by working together. Where possible we try to solve problems from within and we try to benefit all members in our approaches.

## What we offer

### Open source, but for money

We believe that money _can_ complement other incentives to contribute to open source software.&#x20;

We believe that by adopting the practices we use in open software development to financial management we gain the same benefits and incorporate the same values.

### Accounting

We take care of invoices, bank transfers, tax filings, contracts, and legal issues, helping you to focus on the work you _love_ to do rather than the work you _have_ to do.&#x20;

### Flexibility

Whether you lead an open source project or a team looking to sponsor projects, we offer a range of flexible ways to manage your money. We can work with and alongside other foundations, charities and organisations to give you more freedom in how you choose to manage your projects.&#x20;

### Representation and unity &#x20;

With over 3,000 registered projects we are one of the largest fiscal host organizations in the world. We are here to represent you, your community and the broader ‘open source’ movement in the conversations that impact us and our work.&#x20;

### Networking, development and peer support

We provide forums to learn from one another, to help one another, and to work to solve the challenges that our community faces. We do this through events, forums, debate, and mentorship programs.

### Opportunities

We continue to experiment with ways and reasons to contribute to open source projects, partner with individuals and organisations to build capacity and develop skills within projects, and work with institutions to bring the benefits of open source to less-privileged communities.

## Our Strategy

In January 2022 we [published our strategy](https://blog.opencollective.com/open-source-collectives-strategy-2022-2025/) which included three strategic goals:

> Taking an ecosystem-wide approach to supporting open source software\
> \
> Enabling projects to use their money as well as raise it\
> \
> Make financially contributing to open source not only a good business decision, but an easy one

We continue to iterate on our strategy, and we welcome feedback on our work, see contact details below.&#x20;
