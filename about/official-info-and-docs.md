### Banking Info

All transactions should be set up on Open Collective wherever possible. If someone makes a contribution and selects 'bank transfer' as the payment method, they will automatically receive these details.&#x20;

However, if you need our banking information to initiate a transfer, please contact us at  hello@oscollective.org.

If you are expecting payments outside the platform to arrive, these are not automated, so you must [inform us](mailto:hello@oscollective.org) so we can find and credit your funds.
