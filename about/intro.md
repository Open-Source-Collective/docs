# Intro

Open Source Collective is a non-profit working for the common interests of those who create and use open-source software.

Companies get huge value from open source. But up to now, it’s been hard to give back financially unless a project formed its own foundation. Now they don’t have to.

Open Source Collective is a non-profit umbrella organisation providing financial and legal infrastructure for thousands of open source projects. We’re an API between the world of distributed collaboration and the world of accounting and invoices.

#### For Maintainers

Stay focused on your project — let us take care of all the accounting, taxes, invoices, and admin. You decide where the money gets spent, then we make it happen. Plus, your budget will be fully transparent to your community.

#### For Sponsors

Help the open source projects you rely on thrive. Get recognition with your logo on the project’s page. Along with providing invoices, we can meet your accounting and legal requirements and engage with your vendor systems.
