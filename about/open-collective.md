# Open Collective

We often get asked what the difference is between Open Collective and Open Source Collective. They have nearly the same name and overlap in some ways, so that's understandable! 

Open Collective Inc makes the software platform we use to enable our services. They provide their software to many organizations like us, who each host their own communities of Collectives. Open Source Collective and Open Collective were founded by some of the same people, but they are separate entities.

As a Collective or a Fund, your legal and financial relationship is with Open Source Collective. Fees for the service go to OSC. Then OSC pays Open Collective for its use of the software platform, but this transaction doesn't involve end-users.
