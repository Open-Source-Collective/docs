# Mission, Values & Strategy

## Mission

Our mission is to promote sustainability and health in the open source ecosystem, while working to benefit all those who create and use open source software.

## Vision

To create an environment where it is as rewarding and financially secure to build and maintain software for the commons as it is for corporations.

## Values

**Impact**: we are not a neutral platform\
**Collectivity**: we are building collective power\
**Inclusivity**: we are here for many different kinds of people \
**Honesty**: we act with integrity\
**Transparency**: we are authentically and accessibly open \
**Privacy**: we respect individual privacy\
**Dignity**: we treat others with respect\
**Sustainability and resilience**: we are here for the long haul

## Strategy

In January 2022 we [published our strategy](https://blog.opencollective.com/open-source-collectives-strategy-2022-2025/) which included three strategic goals to help us deliver on our mission:

> Taking an ecosystem-wide approach to supporting open source software\
> \
> Enabling projects to use their money as well as raise it\
> \
> Make financially contributing to open source not only a good business decision but an easy one
