**Transparency**: we are authentically and accessibly open \
**Privacy**: we respect individual privacy\
**Dignity**: we treat others with respect\
**Sustainability and resilience**: we are here for the long haul

## Strategy

In January 2022 we [published our strategy](https://blog.opencollective.com/open-source-collectives-strategy-2022-2025/) which included three strategic goals:

> Taking an ecosystem-wide approach to supporting open source software\
> \
> Enabling projects to use their money as well as raise it\
> \
> Make financially contributing to open source not only a good business decision, but an easy one

We continue to iterate on our strategy, and we welcome feedback on our work, see contact details below.&#x20;
