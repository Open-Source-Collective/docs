1. Read through our full documentation and review the [Terms of Fiscal Sponsorship Agreement](https://docs.oscollective.org/legal/terms-of-fiscal-sponsorship)
2. Ensure that you meet [our acceptance criteria](https://docs.oscollective.org/getting-started/acceptance-criteria) and are familiar with the Open Collective[ Community Guidelines](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/about/community-guidelines)
3. Have at least 2 community members ready to add as[ admins](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/core-contributors). Admins have full permissions to change settings, approve expenses, and make financial contributions from the budget balance of your collective. Applications with less than 2 admins will not be accepted.
4. Review our [fees](https://docs.oscollective.org/getting-started/fees)

### As a reminder:

* You retain ownership of all your intellectual property.
* We will hold and manage funds on behalf of your collective, and we won't use them for anything else.
* If you want to enter into an agreement with anyone else as your collective, such as a contract with a vendor or providing a specific service to a sponsor, [you need to get in touch](https://docs.oscollective.org/legal/contracts-with-third-parties). Legally the agreement would be with Open Source Collective.

### The application:

Applying to be hosted by Open Source Collective takes only minutes! **When you are ready, you can** [**go to our profile**](https://opencollective.com/opensource) **and click**[ **Apply**](https://www.opencollective.com/foundation/apply)**!** Fill out the application questions, accept the Open Collective platform terms of service, and submit.

Everything you enter into the application will be editable later on, so don't worry about making it perfect.

‚ùì If we have questions about your application, we may reach out to you to schedule a chat or request additional materials.

üö´ If your application is rejected, you will be informed as to why. You are welcome to reapply if adjustments are made to align with our requirements. We try to respond to applications within two business days.

‚úÖ If your collective is accepted, congratulations! Once you have set up your collective‚Äôs Open Collective page, you can begin accepting contributions (donations). We will reach out to notify you of your acceptance. We will provide you with a copy of your application for your reference (you may want to use the answers you submitted to[ expand and customize](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/customize-collective) your Open Collective profile) and instructions for how to get started!

Be sure to check your Spam folder for correspondence from OSC. Sometimes our emails end up in there.

### Moving to Open Collective:

If you are transitioning from another fiscal host that uses the Open Collective platform, the[ process is relatively simple](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/change-fiscal-host#what-is-the-process-for-changing-fiscal-hosts). If your collective is currently with another organization that does not use Open Collective, the process will depend on that organization‚Äôs requirements, but in a nutshell they can transfer your money over and you can get up and running with OSC.

Please be sure to communicate your plans to both OSC and your old fiscal host in advance of your application to ensure a smooth transition. Once you have tied up any loose ends with your current host, they can transfer the funds to us electronically or send it to us by check. We can issue an invoice to them and sign agreements if needed. Our normal[ fees](https://docs.oscollective.org/getting-started/fees) apply to funds transferred in.
