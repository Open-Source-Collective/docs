# Eligibility Requirements

{% hint style="success" %}
Our goal is "to promote a sustainable and healthy ecosystem to sustain open source technology for the future." We're working towards this goal - if you think that you fit this requirement and the following doesn't completely apply to you, [let us know](mailto:hello@oscollective.org).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Open Source Projects

When applying on behalf of an open source community, your project must meet the following conditions:

### Legitimacy

* [ ] Your project must be **novel or a substantial fork** of an existing project.
* [ ] Your project must show **recent activity** and/or a significant **degree of usage**.
* [ ] The applicant(s) must demonstrate an **appropriate level of access and standing in the community** to act as a representative i.e. be a 'maintainer' rather than a 'contributor'.

We look at the ownership, activity, usage, and originality of the project.&#x20;

### License

Since the goal of the Open Source Collective is to support a Free and Open Source ecosystem, your project license is critically important. The list of [Open Source Initiative Approved License List](https://opensource.org/licenses) can serve as a gauge for valid open license criteria to the collective.&#x20;

* [ ] Your project **must have a license** clearly defining how your project can be used, modified, redistributed and referenced by others.&#x20;

The goal of the Open Source Collective is to promote a sustainable and healthy ecosystem to sustain open source technology for the future, and your project license is _critically_ important to us.&#x20;

Other valid licensing guidelines include the following:&#x20;

When determining whether a project's license is appropriate, we look to guides like [Open Source Initiative's Approved Licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses) and other licensing guidelines like:&#x20;

1. [Free Software Foundation License List](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html)
2. [Debian Free Software Guidelines](https://wiki.debian.org/DFSGLicenses)
3. [Fedora Software License List](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing:Main?rd=Licensing)
4. [Open Source Hardware Association Statement of Principles](https://www.oshwa.org/definition/)

### Governance and Autonomy&#x20;

* [ ] If possible, your project should include **two or more administrators.**
* [ ] Your repository should belong to an entity with appropriate access control i.e. **not a personal repository.**

Open Source Collective does not impose a structure, a process, or a statute on you and your community but as a small organisation supporting a broad range of open source communities we rely on you to operate a robust and effective decision-making process within your project.\
\
It is important to take into consideration how easily a project could continue if you or another core contributor takes leave.

We encourage projects to publish [contributing guides](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors), onboarding documents, codes of conduct, and other forms of governance documentation.&#x20;

If you are looking for guidance or best practices in setting these up, we publish a range of guides and host regular [community calls](https://opencollective.com/opensource/events) to facilitate new projects tackling this work.&#x20;

### Validation

If you are an open source project on GitHub you will likely be immediately approved. We have a built-in process that automates validation using GitHub authentication ([more info](../how-to-apply/github-verification.md)).

If your project is on GitLab or hosted on an another platform you'll need to complete our application form ([more info](../how-to-apply/manual-verification.md)).&#x20;

## Open Source Adjacent Communities

We also consider applications from communities with a strong link to free and open source software. We use the following criteria:

* [ ] Your project must be strongly affiliated with or related to open source, not proprietary technology or any other topics.

### Meetups, conferences and other groups&#x20;

* [ ] should have at least 50 members,
* [ ] should have organized at least 2 events previously,&#x20;
* [ ] should be able to show a history of activity by members.&#x20;

As further evidence, you agree to send photo/video documentation of your first event after joining Open Source Collective.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Larger events may require specific risk assessment by our board. No expenses will be paid in advance of sufficient funds being available in the Collective budget (e.g. hiring a venue).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
All agreements between your Collective and third parties, such as venues, contractors, speakers, etc, require explicit written permission and involvement of the OSC administrators.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
