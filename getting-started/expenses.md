# Payouts

Individuals and organizations can request payment from a collective by[ submitting an expense](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/submitting-expenses).

### The Process

Using funds from your collective’s budget is simple:

1. Someone submits an[ expense](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/submitting-expenses). (Collective admins also have the option of drafting an expense and then[ sending an invitation to someone else to complete and submit it](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/submitting-expenses#inviting-a-third-party-to-submit-an-expense).)
2. A collective[ admin](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/core-contributors#roles) (someone on your team) approves it.
3. OSC's team reviews the expense (and confirms that the expense meets requirements, e.g., having a valid receipt).
4. The expense recipient gets[ paid](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/fiscal-hosts/payouts#what-payment-methods-do-you-support-for-withdrawals).

Expenses are processed and paid out by Open Source Collective **twice per week** (on Mondays and Thursdays).&#x20;

OSC can[ pay out funds](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/expenses#by-what-method-can-i-get-paid) via PayPal and electronic bank transfer via Wise (f.k.a. Transferwise). Make sure to review the[ Expenses and Getting Paid](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/expenses) section of Open Collective’s documentation for a full overview of the process.

If you have any issues with a specific expense, the best way to get an answer is to post a comment on that expense page.

### About expenses

Expense payments may relate to either an[ Invoice](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/submitting-expenses#invoices) for work completed for the collective:

* Invoices are used to pay people for work completed or their goods/services.
* Within the invoice option, you can either upload your own invoice, or you can create one directly on the platform. You will be able to detail what the services/goods are, and can include multiple items
* When someone uses invoices, they are treated as an independent contractor. If earnings exceed $600 in a year, they will be automatically issued a 1099 tax form to fill out per IRS regulations. (Reimbursements do not trigger the 1099 form). More info about taxes[ here](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/tax-information).

...or a[ Reimbursement](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/submitting-expenses#reimbursements) for purchases made on behalf of the collective:

* Reimbursements are used to pay people (often volunteers) back when they have made purchases for the group - in these cases, receipts are required so that we can ensure the requested amount matches the purchased amount in order to approve the reimbursement.

### For admins

Collective admins can[ set an expense policy](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/expense-policy) to give guidance to expense submitters.
