# Setting Up GitHub Sponsors

Open Source Collective projects can use Open Collective to receive GitHub Sponsors funds by following these steps:

* Confirm that you have a **GitHub organization** (not an individual user account). You can create a GitHub organization by following [this guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch).
* [Create a Collective](https://opencollective.com/opensource/apply) for your open source project if you don't already have one. You will need to use Open Source Collective as your fiscal host. &#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
_Organisations on Open Collective are not the same as Organisations on GitHub. You must create a Collective in order to manage your project's finances on Open Collective._
{% endhint %}

* Visit [github.com/sponsors](http://github.com/sponsors) and sign your Github organization up for the Sponsors waitlist:\
  &#x20; \
  ✔️ Select: "This organization is using a fiscal host" and select _Open Source Collective_ from the menu.  \
  \
  ✔️ Add your Collective's URL to the 'Fiscal host project profile URL' box for example: [https://opencollective.com/babel](https://opencollective.com/babel)&#x20;

![Be sure to select 'Open Source Collective' from the dropdown.](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2021-12-29 at 13.15.42.png>)

Click Join Waitlist. GitHub staff will review your application, and you'll be notified when you can proceed to the next step.&#x20;

Open Source Collective acts as your legal and financial home. You do not need to enter your own Stripe account  or business information. \
\
If you reach this step please contact [support@opencollective.com](mailto:suport@opnollec) and we will amend your application with GitHub.&#x20;

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What fees will be charged?

The standard Open Collective and Open Source Collective fees apply to funds raised via GitHub Sponsors: 10%. GitHub does not charge a fee.

### Should I create an Organization or a Collective?

Confusingly, GitHub and Open Collective use the word "organization" to mean two different things.

* **On GitHub, you need to create an Organization** to use Sponsors for your project.
* **On Open Collective, you need to create a Collective** for your project (Organizations on Open Collective are a different profile type, for companies who sponsors open source projects, i.e. designed for paying money out, not accepting money like Collectives.
