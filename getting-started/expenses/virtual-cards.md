# Virtual Cards

## What is a virtual card?

Virtual cards are debit card numbers that can be issued to OSC's hosted initiatives for paying online for things like: recurring payments, utility bills, online resources/tools, subscriptions, vendors (e.g. wholesale distributors), etc. They are directly tied to collectives' budget on the Open Collective platform.

## How it works

* Funds are spent only as transactions occur. (Setting up a card does not remove any money from your initiative's budget.)
* Submit a virtual card request with the intended use of the card **(please specify the names of the services you will use)** and the amount budgeted for that use monthly **(e.g. $300/monthly)**. The virtual card with that limit will be set up for your collective.
* If your collective needs a higher limit on your virtual card please request a limit increase by contacting us at hello@oscollective.org **** with the intended use and the amount increase needed.
  * To receive an increase, initiative must have a budget on their Open Collective account that exceeds the corresponding amount, and must demonstrate that a higher limit is necessary.
* Cards must be used in compliance with our policy below.

## **Requirements/Policy:** <a href="#requirements-policy" id="requirements-policy"></a>

* Initiatives must have a minimum of 2 admin members
* These are **virtual cards.** No physical card will be issued, so these cannot be used in-store.
* All transactions should comply with normal usage of initiative funds as outlined in our [Terms of Fiscal Sponsorship](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-LWSZizNMEjL8\_DrMNdF/s/-M9Neg20-zKzu0MhF2d2/getting-started/terms)​

**Limitations:**

* Virtual cards **may not** be used for [paying/reimbursing people](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-LWSZizNMEjL8\_DrMNdF/s/-M9Neg20-zKzu0MhF2d2/how-it-works/payouts)-that should be done on the OC platform.
