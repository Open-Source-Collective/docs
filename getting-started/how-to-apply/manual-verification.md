# Manual Verification

If your project is not centred on a Github repository, or you can't get the automated verification system to work, you can request manual verification.

1. Ensure your project meets the [acceptance criteria](../acceptance-criteria.md).
2. Go to [https://opencollective.com/opensource/apply](https://opencollective.com/opensource/apply)
3. Agree to the terms of fiscal sponsorship
4. Click 'Request manual verification'
5. Proceed to create your Collective and await manual review
