# Domain Transfers and Registration

### Domains

Open Source Collective uses Namecheap as our domain registrar. Transferring a domain to Namecheap costs around \~$15. Renewal costs will vary depending on the top-level domain. All costs are charged to your Collective.

To initiate a transfer of a domain to our registrar, please reach out to ​hello@oscollective.org and fill out the domain transfer [form](https://form.asana.com/?k=wURNAlWdGOZwNgKpZ3kGIQ\&d=477117439367644).

Transferring a domain to Open Source Collective will require you to 'unlock' the domain with your current registrar and share an Authorization Code (or Auth Code/EPP Code) with us. We will import your current configuration and migrate the domain to our registrar with a new virtual card issued on your collective.&#x20;

### Domain Manager

Following the successful transfer of the domain, Open Source Collective will extend an invitation to the respective collective admin as Domain Manager. The Domain Manager will manage the domain billings such as Domain Renewal, and will get limited permissions like updating name servers, etc.&#x20;

Open Source Collective will not be accountable for domain renewal and associated billing responsibilities. Instead, The Domain Manager will be tasked with managing and responsible for domain renewal and billings, the Domain Manager will have the option to utilize a virtual card issued by Open Source Collective or their own personal payment card (the Domain Manager is eligible for reimbursements from their collective).

### Using a CDN

It is recommended that you use a CDN like CloudFlare to manage your domain. This enables Open Source Collective to act as the domain owner while you maintain your own domain's DNS configuration.

If you have not done so already, we recommend that you set your domain's nameservers to those provided by your CDN before initiating a transfer. Instructions to do so can be found in your CDN's documentation: ​

### Updating Nameservers

Open Source Collective or the collective Domain Manager can update the domain's configuration as necessary but, as detailed above, we prefer that your organization remain in control of day-to-day configuration through a CDN provider like Cloudflare.
