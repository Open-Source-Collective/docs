# Virtual Cards

{% hint style="warning" %}
We have temporarily stopped our virtual cards program, if you need help or have a request regarding a virtual card please reach out to hello@oscollective.org. Our [announcement](https://opencollective.com/opensource/updates/closing-our-virtual-card-program) on virtual cards.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Virtual Cards can be issued to hosted Collectives for paying recurring payments, bills, online resources and tools, subscriptions, vendors (e.g. hosting providers), etc.

## How it works

* Funds are spent only as transactions occur. - Setting up a card does not remove any money from your Collective's budget.
* Submit a virtual card request (click 'Actions' > 'request virtual card on your Collective's page) with the intended use of the card and the amount budgeted for that monthly. The virtual card with that limit will be set up for your collective.
* If, at any point, your collective needs a higher limit on your virtual card, please request a limit increase by contacting us at hello@oscollective.org with the intended use and the amount increase needed.
* Cards must be used in compliance with our policy below.
* Each collective can have one virtual card.

## **Requirements / Policy:**

* These are **virtual cards.** No physical card will be issued, so these cannot be used in-store.
* Receipts must be submitted within 30 days. If a receipt is not submitted within 30 days, the card access will be paused until you do submit the receipt
  * The card's Assignee is responsible for collecting and uploading the receipts.&#x20;
* All transactions should comply with normal usage of Collective funds as outlined in our [Terms of Fiscal Sponsorship](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vQbiyK2Fe0jLdh4vb9BfHY4bJ1LCo4Qvy0jg9P29ZkiC8y\_vKJ\_1fNgIbV0p6UdvbcT8Ql1gVto8bf9/pub)

**Limitations and Exclusions**

* Virtual cards **may not** be used for [paying/reimbursing people](broken-reference) - that should be done on the OC platform.

#### If you need to input Cardholder contact details/address:

* **Name**: Open Source Collective
* **Address**: 440 N Barranca Ave #3939 Covina, CA 91723&#x20;

## Steps

#### Setup the card:

1.  Collective admins request the card

    1. Visit your Collective's page

2\. We will assign the virtual card (please allow 2-3 working days to process your request)

3\. Once assigned, the card assignee will be notified via email. The card's details will appear in the Collective's **Settings** for admins to use. (in accordance with this policy)

#### â€‹After a purchase is made:

1. The funds will be withdrawn from your Collective
2. An "Invitation to submit an expense" will be sent to your Collective admins
   1. Admins will be asked to submit your receipt. **(If the receipt is not submitted within 30 days, the card access will be paused until you do submit the receipt)**.
