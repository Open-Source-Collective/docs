# The Open Collective Platform

### Manage your finances

The Open Collective platform gives every open source project we host a profile online where they can:

* Raise money
* Manage and pay expenses
* Display their transparent budget
* Post Updates
* Host Events
* and more!!

Thanks to transparency, you can see all of our hosted projects' activities and how they use the features for yourself. (See a list of our hosted collectives [here](https://opencollective.com/opensource).)

### Transparency

One of the greatest strengths of our platform is the full transparency of both where money comes from and where it goes. When expenses are approved or contributions come through, the balance is updated in real time!&#x20;

The ability to see your initiative’s financial position and goals gives credibility to your organization, especially in the early stages, and helps to build an environment of collaboration and trust.

With a transparent process, team members and contributors can feel confident that the funds are being put to good use, while private details like emails, names, and addresses are only visible to administrators. Financial transparency creates stronger collaboration. Plus, when it’s time to report back to funders, you can just send them a link to your Open Collective profile.

The platform’s financial features also encourage best practices:

* No more messy spreadsheets
* Clear system of approvals and oversight
* Financial processes are accessible to your team, funders, and community

Administrators, team members, contributors, and third parties such as potential funders or partners can all see what funds are coming in and what funds are going out. We make it easy for projects to work with money.
