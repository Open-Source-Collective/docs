# Grants for Conference Attendance and Conference Organizers

### For attendees

We're delighted to support to open source maintainers to attend non-technical conferences. \
\
We recognize that many maintainers find themselves in a leadership role within their community but may not have the necessary resources to expand their knowledge outside of technical areas. We believe that by attending these events, maintainers can improve their project management skills and become more well-rounded leaders.

We encourage collectives to use their budget to reimburse their members for attending such events. However, we understand that not all collectives have the financial means to do so. In such cases, **we're happy to cover the cost of your ticket**.&#x20;

To apply for funding, simply submit an expense [(here)](https://opencollective.com/conferences) from your collective and make sure to include the cost of the ticket.&#x20;

You can find more information about our decision and the types of conferences we support on our [announcement here](https://opencollective.com/opensource/updates/subsidising-confrence-and-events-for-open-source-maintainers-inc-foss-backstage-17-18th-march).

### For organizers

In addition to supporting individuals with conference attendance, we're also excited to share that Open Source Collective will offer support to open source conferences. Please read below to learn more.

**Financial Support**

We can help with specific costs, such as venue fees, room sponsorship, and accessibility options. We also understand that organizing an event involves many different elements, so if there’s another area where you could use support, we’d love to hear about it.

The amount of financial support we provide will depend on the event's specific needs and the availability of our sponsorship funds.

**Promotional Support**

To boost awareness and attendance, we can help promote events through our channels, such as our monthly community update sent to our hosted collectives.

### When deciding to sponsor an event, we consider:

**Shared Values**

* Events must align with OSC’s mission to promote open source sustainability, focusing on community, learning, and education, not major industry gatherings.
* Supported events must have a code of conduct, be inclusive, and feature diverse speakers.

**Open Source Focus**

* We prioritize events benefiting open source maintainers, especially those sharing content openly.

**Financial Need**

* We prioritize smaller events needing financial support over large, well-funded ones.

**Impact and Reach**

* We support conferences that make a difference, offer in-person and virtual attendance, and encourage participation over lectures.

### How to Apply for Financial Sponsorship

1. **Initial Inquiry**
   * Email us at [hello@oscollective.org](mailto:hello@oscollective.org). Provide some basic details about the event, what you’re hoping to achieve, and what kind of support you need, considering the criteria listed above.
   * In your email, please include the following:
     * Event overview and objectives
     * What specifically you’re asking OSC to sponsor
     * What the funding will be used for
     * How our support will impact the open source ecosystem
     * Any other sources of funding or support your event is receiving
2. **Review and Decision**
   * Our team will review inquiries based on the criteria above and reach out with questions.
   * Please send any requests for funding at least 30 working days before the event.

### How to Apply for Promotional Support

We can share your event information with our community through our marketing and communication channels. To do so, please send an email to [hello@oscollective.org](mailto:hello@oscollective.org) with the following:

* name, date, location of event, including URL
* short description and target audience
* associated cost or ticket price
* social media handles for tagging

### After the Event

We'd love to hear about your event's success! Please follow up with us afterward, as we’d love to share your event’s materials with our hosted projects. We'd appreciate it if you could share:

• A summary of the event&#x20;

• Photos or videos you're comfortable sharing&#x20;

• Links to recordings or other materials

Not only does this help us showcase the impact of our support to the broader community, but it also increases your event’s visibility, potentially attracting future collaborators and participants.
