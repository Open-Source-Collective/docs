# Grants for Conference Attendance

We're delighted to offer support to open source maintainers who are interested in attending non-technical conferences. We recognize that many maintainers find themselves in a leadership role within their community but may not have the necessary resources to expand their knowledge outside of technical areas. We believe that by attending these events, maintainers can improve their project management skills and become more well-rounded leaders.

We also encourage collectives to use their budget to reimburse their members for attending such events. However, we understand that not all collectives have the financial means to do so. In such cases, **we're happy to cover the costs**.&#x20;

To apply for funding, simply submit an expense [(here)](https://opencollective.com/conferences) from your collective and make sure to include the cost of the ticket.&#x20;

You can find more information about our decision and the types of conferences we support on our [announcement here](https://opencollective.com/opensource/updates/subsidising-confrence-and-events-for-open-source-maintainers-inc-foss-backstage-17-18th-march).
