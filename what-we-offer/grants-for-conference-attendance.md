# Grants for Conference Attendance

We supporting open source maintainers to attend **non-technical conferences** with free/subsidized tickets.  __  [_Read more_ ](https://opencollective.com/opensource/updates/subsidising-confrence-and-events-for-open-source-maintainers-inc-foss-backstage-17-18th-march)about our decision and the types of conferences that are supported.

We believe that many maintainers inherit a position of 'community leader' and have little support for expanding their knowledge in non-technical directions and that this could greatly improve their ability to manage their projects.\
\
We encourage projects to use their Collective budget to reimburse members of their community for events like these. _If your collective doesn't have the funds to do so, we'll cover it._&#x20;

Apply for funding [here](https://opencollective.com/conferences) by submitting an expense from your collective and make sure to attach the cost of the ticket.
