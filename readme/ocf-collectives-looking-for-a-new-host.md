# OCF collectives looking for a new host

As per [this announcement](https://opencollective.com/foundation/updates/announcement-we-are-dissolving-open-collective-foundation-at-the-end-of-this-year) made on Feb 27th, 2024, Open Collective Foundation will dissolve its nonprofit entity effective December 31, 2024. If you are currently hosted by OCF and considering OSC as your new fiscal host, here are some things to consider before applying.

## We are different business entities

* Open Collective Foundation (OCF), a 501c3 nonprofit&#x20;
* Open Source Collective (OSC), a 501c6 nonprofit&#x20;
* Open Collective (OC Inc), a US-based LLC&#x20;

## OCF and OSC are different types of nonprofits

OCF is a 501(c)(3). A c3 nonprofit is for public benefit.&#x20;

OSC is a 501(c)(6). A c6 nonprofit is for member benefit.

The governing body that classifies what projects are considered a public benefit does not consider open-source projects a public benefit unless they can clearly show the funds will be used for public benefit. This is generally true for open-source projects with an educational or scientific research focus.&#x20;

Please refer to a lawyer for more information regarding your designation. Here's some articles written by nonprofit lawyers to help explain the decision by the IRS:

## What does that mean to me?

As a c6, OSC supports open source projects from maintainers to funders. We have fewer restrictions on what type of open source projects we can accept then a c3 does. (please refer to our [guidelines](../getting-started/acceptance-criteria/))&#x20;

We also have fewer requirements around the documentation we need for expenses. Please see our guides on what we need to see in expenses [here](../how-it-works/basics/invoice-and-reimbursement-examples.md).

That said, there are some things we won't be able to offer that c3's can including

* tax-deductible receipts to donors&#x20;
* fundraising support

## OK, I want to join OSC

Great! In order to transfer your collective from OCF to OSC please do the following

1. Spend down the balance in your OCF collective to $0. You can do this by paying out expenses or invoices or by donating your remaining balance to another c3 organization.
2. Unhost your collective from OCF (steps outlined [here](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/fiscal-hosts/fiscal-host-dashboard/hosted-collectives#unhosting-a-collective)).
3. Submit an application to be hosted by OSC [here](https://opencollective.com/opensource).
