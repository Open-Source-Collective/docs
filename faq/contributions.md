# Contributions FAQ

#### How do I cancel recurring donations/subscriptions/payments?

See our instructions on how to cancel recurring or ongoing donations, subscriptions, payments, etc., [here](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/financial-contributors/payments#change-the-amount-payment-method-or-cancel-an-existing-contribution).

#### What if a contributor wants their contribution to be anonymous?

Contributors can make an anonymous payment by choosing [incognito](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/financial-contributors/payments#profile) when picking a profile to pay from. If the contributor contributes as a [guest](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/financial-contributors/payments#contributing-as-a-guest), then the given name will still show up, the contributor then just won’t have to log in to make the payment. All Open Collective users can also [differentiate](https://opencollective.com/opencollective/updates/new-legal-and-display-name-settings) a public display name from their private legal name.

#### What if a financial contributor is unable or not comfortable with submitting their credit card information online?

If a donor is not comfortable with online credit card transactions, they can send the funds via PayPal or bank transfer.

#### Someone said they sent my collective money but I don’t see it in my account! Help?

If you’re a collective, ping us! We often receive money into our bank account without any indication of where it should go. (This is why it's so important to include the name of the collective in any correspondence/check/transfer that gets sent to OSC). We don't use/disperse that money anywhere until we know who its for, so it just sits in our account until someone claims it., Just send us a message (via[ Slack](http://slack.opencollective.com) or [email](https://docs.oscollective.org/about/contact)) with screenshots/receipts that include the dollar amount, the collective name and the sender/any info about the bank transfer, so that we may get your funds to you.

#### What if a financial contributor requests a donation invoice?

Reach out to us at hello@oscollective.org. We are happy to procure an invoice of this kind when requested. Please be ready to provide: Donor name, Email, Collective Name, & Donation amount (+ screenshots/links if applicable) for context.

#### Can we use outside fundraising platforms to fundraise for our collective?

We recommend using Open Collective as much as possible so that you can manage your full budget in one place, but you may use other platforms to raise funds for your community. In some cases we may be able to accept payments from third party platforms like Patreon, GoFundMe, Kofi, etc. directly. To set up something like that, reach out to us at hello@oscollective.org.

#### Can we receive earned income (i.e., non-donations) or sell stuff through OSC?

Yup! You'll want to move funds into your budget in some way, however. Feel free to reach out to us to discuss the proper logistics for your situation.

#### Can we offer financial contributors something in return for their donation?

Yup! This can be done through the [Tiers](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/collective-settings/tiers-goals#tiers) feature. You'll want to think in advance about the proper way to gather any information you need in order to fulfill your promises.

#### Can my group offer memberships/accept membership fees?

Check out Open Collective’s [Tiers](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/collective-settings/tiers-goals#tiers) feature!

#### Can my collective donate to another hosted collective?

Collectives[ can easily give to other collectives](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/financial-contributors/collective-to-collective) hosted by Open Source Collective. (If you want to give to a collective with another fiscal host there are[ some extra steps](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/financial-contributors/collective-to-collective#across-different-fiscal-hosts).)
