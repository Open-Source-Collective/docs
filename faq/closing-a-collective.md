#### How do I close my collective?

You will need to do the following before you can close or archive your collective.

1. Zero out the balance (more info [here](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/collective-settings/zero-collective-balance)). You can continue to pay invoices or reimbursements or you can donate the remainder to another nonprofit.
2. Provide written confirmation that the account should be closed from a collective admin. This should be sent from the email address associated to the admin's account on the Open Collective platform.&#x20;
3. Publish a public update on the collective's page in the 'About' or 'Conversations' area to indicate the status change of the collective and effective date.
4. Let any donors know that they should cancel recurring contributions. This can be done in the public message.

#### Can I switch to a different fiscal host?

Absolutely. Reach out to us at hello@oscollective.org and we can help transfer any funds you may have in your balance to your new fiscal host.

Please note, we can only transfer funds to another nonprofit.
