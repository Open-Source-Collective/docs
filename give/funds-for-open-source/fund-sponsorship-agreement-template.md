# Fund Sponsorship Agreement Template

The standard terms of fiscal sponsorship agreement covers the creation of a Fund and is part of the setup with its admins.

For cases where a sponsor who did not create the Fund and does not administrate the Fund is putting money into the Fund, we have a template legal agreement. 

Sometimes sponsors have their own template to work from, and in those cases we can use theirs, but when they ask us to provide one, it can be based on this template.
