# What is OSC?

Open Source Collective is a nonprofit working for the common interests of those who create and use open-source software, bringing open source philosophy and values to financial management. As a nonprofit fiscal host (a.k.a. fiscal sponsor or foundation), we provide **financial and legal infrastructure** for **thousands of open source projects**. Weâ€™re the â€˜API' between the world of open source communities and the world of accounting and invoices.
