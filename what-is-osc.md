# What is OSC?

Open Source Collective is a 501c6 nonprofit working for the common interests of those who create and use open-source software. As a nonprofit fiscal host (a.k.a. fiscal sponsor or foundation), we provide the **financial and legal infrastructure** for **thousands of open source projects**. Weâ€™re the â€˜API' between the world of open source communities and the world of accounting and invoices.

## How we Think

### People are more important than code

Open source software is a byproduct of active communities working toward a common goal. We prioritize the needs of people first.&#x20;

### One size does not fit all

Open Source Collective does not impose a structure, a process, or a statute on you and your community.&#x20;

### Strength lies in _community_

That said, we do believe that strength comes from broad and diverse community-centered approaches. We encourage members to think about distributing their responsibilities and building communities.&#x20;

### Solving problems _together_

We believe that we can address many of the problems we face by working together. Where possible, we try to solve problems from within and we try to benefit all members in our approaches.

## Who we're for

### For Maintainers

We take care of all the accounting, taxes, invoices, and administration. You decide where the money gets spent, then we make it happen.&#x20;

## Our Strategy

In January 2022 we [published our strategy](https://blog.opencollective.com/open-source-collectives-strategy-2022-2025/) which included three strategic goals:

> Taking an ecosystem-wide approach to supporting open source software\
> \
> Enabling projects to use their money as well as raise it\
> \
> Make financially contributing to open source not only a good business decision, but an easy one

We continue to iterate on our strategy, and we welcome feedback on our work, see contact details below.&#x20;
