If you have an existing [Polar account](https://polar.sh/) and  your open source project is already hosted by Open Source Collective, you can apply to receive the Polar donations to your Open Collective profile (If your project is fiscally hosted by Open Source Collective) please get in touch with our support at hello@oscollective.org. &#x20;

Polar donations are processed periodically or on a monthly/quarterly basis. We can't accept donations if your project is not hosted by us. You can apply to Open Source Collective [here](https://opencollective.com/opensource/apply). &#x20;
