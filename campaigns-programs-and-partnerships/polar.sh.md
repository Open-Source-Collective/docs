If you have an existing [Polar account](https://polar.sh/) and  your open source project is already hosted by Open Source Collective, you can follow the Polar guide: [https://docs.polar.sh/finance/accounts](https://docs.polar.sh/finance/accounts) to receive the payout  to your Open Collective profile (If your project is fiscally hosted by Open Source Collective)&#x20;

Polar donations are processed periodically or on a monthly/quarterly basis. We can't accept donations if your project is not hosted by us. You can apply to Open Source Collective [here](https://opencollective.com/opensource/apply). &#x20;

Please get in touch with our support at hello@oscollective.org with your collective name/URL.&#x20;
