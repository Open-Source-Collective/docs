# Funds

### What is a Fund?

A Fund is a profile created under OSC for the purpose of moving money frictionlessly to multiple open source projects. Some Funds are created on behalf of a particular company while others are focused on a topic. Here are examples of some funds:

* Google's [Open Source CMS Fund](https://opencollective.com/google-open-source-cms-fund)
* General [Google Open Source Fund](https://opencollective.com/google)
* [Airbnb Fund](https://opencollective.com/airbnb)
* [Indeed Fund](https://opencollective.com/indeed)
* [Facebook Open Source Fund](https://opencollective.com/fbopensource)
* Igalia’s[ Open Prioritization Fund](https://opencollective.com/open-prioritization)

### Why do we need Funds?

Big companies call the process of paying for stuff “procurement”. It’s often pretty involved, with contracts, invoices, purchasing order numbers, and bureaucracy—a painful thing to go through repeatedly for small amounts.

It is simpler and more practical for corporations to make one large payment to one vendor, OSC. As an umbrella non-profit, we are set up for exactly this and Funds are a feature on the platform that can help companies disperse multiple payments to open source projects easily.

We help companies invest in open source projects because we want open source creators to have a good livelihood and work sustainably, which is critical to the health of the whole ecosystem. Think of Funds as [an API for funders](https://blog.opencollective.com/zeit/) to give support to and build relationships with the maintainers of their dependencies.

The key to creating scalable, resilient projects is to support the community as a whole in ways that serve the full range of projects and creators. Open Collective liberates corporate support, getting it directly to projects at scale, across languages and ecosystems.

The only real limitation is that all money spent through OSC must be directed at supporting open source projects and communities.

### Who can Funds pay?

You don’t have to be on Open Collective or hosted by OSC to receive payment from a fund. Any open source project—whether they are part of a company, has its own foundation, works with another fiscal host, or is unincorporated—can get contributions from a Fund.

Please refer to the section [Receiving and Spending Money](../basics.md) for more information on payments via Invoices and Expenses.&#x20;

Funds admins approve what their money gets spent on but when it comes to creating invoices, purchase orders, payment processing, tax forms, etc, they don't need to worry about it. OSC takes care of the administration and paperwork with the payees making the process easier for both parties.

### How is funding decided?

It's up to the creators of the Fund to decide the processes around allocating the Funds' money.&#x20;

* Open Collective has a 'request a grant' function that some use to receive proposals from projects.&#x20;
* Others use their Fund to process payments for an external program with its own process.&#x20;
* Some have an internal team who decides where the money goes and they don't take requests.&#x20;

We carry out the Funds' decisions and handle the logistics, but the Fund administrators are in the driver's seat.
