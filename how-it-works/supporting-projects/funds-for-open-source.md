# Funds

### What is a Fund?

A Fund is a specific type of profile created under OSC for the purpose of moving money frictionlessly to multiple open source projects. Some Funds are created on behalf of a particular company while others are focused on a topic.&#x20;

Here are examples:

* Google's [Open Source CMS Fund](https://opencollective.com/google-open-source-cms-fund)
* General [Google Open Source Fund](https://opencollective.com/google)
* [Airbnb Fund](https://opencollective.com/airbnb)
* [Indeed Fund](https://opencollective.com/indeed)
* [Facebook Open Source Fund](https://opencollective.com/fbopensource)
* Igalia’s[ Open Prioritization Fund](https://opencollective.com/open-prioritization)

### Why should I create a Fund?

If your organisation has multiple funding programs, you have a strong identity for your funding program, you would like to collaborate with other organisations to fund projects, or you simply want to access deposited funds with minimal overhead Funds are for you.&#x20;

#### Your money, on-demand

Funds are accessible to administrators as a funding source when making contributions within the Open Collective platform.&#x20;

#### Support any project anywhere

You don’t have to be on Open Collective or hosted by OSC to receive payment from a fund.&#x20;

#### You're in the driving seat&#x20;

You decide when and how to support projects with your fund, we handle the payments, accounting and legal processes.&#x20;

### Creating a Fund

### Contributing using a Fund

Funds appear as a source for any administrator when making a one-off or recurring contribution to a project on Open Collective. Select the Fund during the 'contribute as' step:

### Invoices and Reimbursements

Individuals and projects can request payments direct from a fund. Reqeustors provide receipts or invoices that are passed to Fund administrators for approval.

### Grants

Funds come with some lightweight 'grantmaking' features:&#x20;

Projects and individuals can request a grant directly from a Fund's profile page. We invite the requestor to provide a description of their activities and upload any supporting documentation. This information is passed to the Fund's administrators for approval.

### Fees

Open Source Collective charges a fixed 10% fee on all contributions received. i.e. we do not charge an additional 10% to Collectives once contributions are made.&#x20;
