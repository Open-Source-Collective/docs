### How it works

We'll work with you to establish the best vehicle for you and your organization, for instance setting up a Fund, issuing employee gift cards, or simply making a large, one-off donation. Then:

* Open Source Collective will register as a provider to your organization including signing any necessary agreements. We also have template agreements of our own and experienced legal counsel to review yours.&#x20;
* Your procurement team may generate a purchase order.
* We'll issue an invoice to your organization.&#x20;
* When the invoice is paid we will distribute the funds as agreed.&#x20;

### Fees

Open Source Collective charges a fixed 10% fee on all contributions received on the initial deposit. i.e. we **do not** charge an additional 10% to Collectives when donation distributions are made.&#x20;
