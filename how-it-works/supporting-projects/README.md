# Making Financial Contributions (Sponsoring)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Contributions to Collectives hosted by the Open Source Collective are not tax-deductible, as we are a 501(c)(6) nonprofit, not a charity 501(c)(3).
{% endhint %}

### How to give

There are many ways you (or your company) can support open source projects hosted by Open Source Collective:

On behalf of our collectives, thank you for your support! We value all of our contributors. If there is anything you need as a donor, please [reach out](../../about/contact.md).

### Credit Card, PayPal, or Bank Transfer

To contribute to an initiative online on the Open Collective platform via Credit Card, PayPal, or Bank Transfer (a.k.a. ACH or wire transfer), please see [this overview of the process](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/financial-contributors/payments).

Once you choose to contribute from the collective’s profile, our platform will guide you through the rest of the process, including choosing between credit card, PayPal, and electronic bank transfer via ACH (US banks only) or wire.

{% hint style="info" %}
The fastest way to have access to funds is through **Card/PayPal donations** made directly on the Open Collective Platform.

**Bank transfers (e.g. ACH, wire)** are done manually - this means it takes the funds a couple of days to clear due to bank processing times. Once the funds are cleared by the bank, the allocation of the funds requires additional actions from OSC. **It is important to allow for a few days (minimum 3\~5 business days) when awaiting donations made via bank transfer.**
{% endhint %}

### **Bank Transfers**

If you select to make a contribution via bank transfer, you will automatically be given bank transfer instructions, on-screen and by email, along with a unique reference ID code.

**You must include the unique ID code as a reference with your bank transfer, so we can match up the transaction.**

Once the money has arrived, we will credit the amount to the initiative’s balance and you will automatically receive a receipt.‌

When you arrange the transfer, if you have the option of sending an email notification for the transaction, please use [our email](../../about/contact.md).

### **Giving Anonymously**

If you would like your contribution to be partially or fully anonymous, see our documentation on incognito and [guest](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/financial-contributors/guest-contributions) contributions.

### **Secure Contributions**

Open Source Collective doesn't store donor credit card numbers on our servers. Instead, we partner with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/security/stripe), a secure solution that is widely adopted by the industry, to process one-time and recurring contributions.

### Donations By Check

Open Source Collective does not accept check donations.

### Fees&#x20;

Open Source Collective charges our hosted Collectives a fixed 10% fee on all contributions received in return for our fiscal hosting services.&#x20;
