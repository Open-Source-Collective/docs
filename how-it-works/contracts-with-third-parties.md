  and likely sign, any agreement for or on behalf of the collectives we host.

# Signing Contracts and Entering Into Legal Agreements

### **For Financial Contributors & Sponsors**

OSC is the legal and financial home of our hosted projects. If you would like to support a project or collective on behalf of your company we can:

* Register as a vendor to your organization, issue invoices, and manage payments on your behalf.
* Provide facilities to manage your financial contributions over the course of the year, like [Funds](supporting-projects/funds-for-open-source.md), Prepaid Budgets, and Gift Cards to your employees that can be used to donate monies to open source collectives on OSC.&#x20;
* Issue template agreements for general or event-specific sponsorship.

{% hint style="info" %}
Collectives can receive their GitHub Sponsor payments directly through the Open Collective platform. [Read more about our partnership.](../campagins-programs-and-partnerships/github-sponsors.md)
{% endhint %}

### **For Admins of Collectives**

You must [contact](../about/contact.md) Open Source Collective before entering into any contract as a Collective since OSC will legally be the organization entering into the contract and must be the signer.
