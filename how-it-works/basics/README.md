# Receiving and Spending Money

{% hint style="success" %}
Once you apply to join Open Source Collective and receive an approval email from us, you can immediately get started with managing your collective on Open Collective.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Open Collective (the platform) <a href="#docs-internal-guid-93351402-7fff-eb72-4817-b23d01650052" id="docs-internal-guid-93351402-7fff-eb72-4817-b23d01650052"></a>

[Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/) is the software platform that Open Source Collective (OSC) uses with our hosted collectives to manage financial contributions and payments. Open Collective has a ton of features like[ transparent budget](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/budget)s, custom[ collective profiles](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/customize-collective),[ donation tiers, fundraising goals](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/tiers-goals), and other tools now at your disposal.

Open Collective is also an [open source](https://github.com/opencollective) project that manages [its own budget](https://opencollective.com/opencollective#category-ABOUT), on the platform!

✅ For an overview of features and how to use the Open Collective platform, check out their[ documentation](https://docs.opencollective.com).&#x20;

## Receiving Funds <a href="#docs-internal-guid-9d3d88de-7fff-93ac-a041-9317b46b3b12" id="docs-internal-guid-9d3d88de-7fff-93ac-a041-9317b46b3b12"></a>

The Open Collective platform offers multiple ways for you to fund your project. Check out the[ Quick Start Guide](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/quick-start-guide), which offers a few great ways to get started.

Our documentation includes information on how people can contribute directly to your collective. Feel free to share [this Financial Contributions overview](../supporting-projects/) with your contributors.

In addition to direct donations, some of our collectives developed innovative ways to fund their projects. Read more about different funding options [here](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/funding-options).

### Receiving Crypto

Open Source Collective has limited support for crypto. Due to the impracticalities of running a payments service at scale and fluctuations in various crypto markets, we **do not hold crypto on behalf of our member projects.** Instead, we will accept crypto, convert it to fiat (USD) and attribute the balance to member projects accordingly.

Projects wishing to accept crypto should email ops@oscollective.org to receive a wallet address managed by Open Source Collective.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that Open Source Collective does not have an 'outside money' policy. You are free to raise, manage and spend crypto (and fiat contributions) separate from the money you raise, manage and spend through Open Source Collective.
{% endhint %}

## Managing Expenses&#x20;

Using funds from your collective’s budget to pay expenses is simple:

1. Someone can submit an[ expense](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/submitting-expenses) on your collective's page OR collective admins can draft an expense and[ send an invitation to someone else to complete and submit it](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/submitting-expenses#inviting-a-third-party-to-submit-an-expense).
2. Once an expense is created, a collective[ admin](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/core-contributors#roles) (someone on your team) must review and approve it as an accurate and expected expense.
3. Next, a member of OSC's team reviews and approves the expense. This is done to ensure the expense meets requirements, e.g., having a valid receipt.
4. Once the expense is verified, the expense recipient gets[ paid](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/fiscal-hosts/payouts#what-payment-methods-do-you-support-for-withdrawals).

Expenses are processed and paid out by Open Source Collective **twice per week** (on Tuesdays and Thursdays).

OSC can[ pay out funds](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/expenses#by-what-method-can-i-get-paid) via PayPal and electronic bank transfer via Wise (f.k.a. Transferwise). Make sure to review the[ Expenses and Getting Paid](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/expenses) section of Open Collective’s documentation for a full overview of the process.

{% hint style="danger" %}
It is the responsibility of the collective admin to ensure that expenses are unique. If a payee files multiple expenses for the same work, please reject duplicate expenses so they are not accidentally paid by the host admin.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Our tax status and the terms of our fiscal sponsorship agreement state that funds can only be used to further the cause of the projects we accept.&#x20;

We have an [incredibly broad policy](./#limitations) on expenses that we will allow but sometimes we may need more information to understand how an expense meets our policy.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

If you have any issues with a specific expense, the best way to get an answer is to post a comment on that expense page.

### Invoices

[Invoices](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/submitting-expenses#invoices) should be used to pay individuals for work completed on behalf of the collective:

* Invoices are used to pay people for work or their services.
* When someone uses an invoice, they are treated as an independent contractor. If earnings for an individual exceed $600 in a year, they will be automatically issued a 1099 tax form to fill out per IRS regulations. This is automatically generated by the Open Collective platform at the end of the year and managed by Open Source Collective. Reimbursement and grant expenses do not trigger the 1099 form. More info about taxes[ here](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/tax-information).
* Within the invoice option, you can either upload your own invoice, or you can create one directly on the platform. You will be able to detail what the services/goods are, and can include multiple items.

### Reimbursements

Create a[ reimbursement](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/submitting-expenses#reimbursements) to pay for purchases or subscriptions made on behalf of the collective:

* Reimbursements **can not** be used to pay contributors for work or labor spent on the project.
* Reimbursements are used to pay people (often volunteers) back when they have made purchases for the group.
* Receipts are required so that we can ensure the requested amount matches the purchased amount in order to approve the reimbursement.

### Outstanding Expenses

The responsibility for ensuring payment completions lies with the collective and/or payee. In case of a payment error, OSC will notify the collective and payee by commenting on the expense ticket. If the collective and/or payee fails to respond and rectify the issue within 30 days, the ticket will be left in an incomplete status. Should payment still be required once the expense is marked as 'incomplete', the collective and/or payee should edit the expense accordingly for payment.

To address pending 'error' payments predating 2023, OSC will make one final attempt to reach out and confirm the necessity of the payment. If no response is received within 30 days, OSC will proceed to close the expense request. If payment is still required, the submitter should resubmit the expense request.&#x20;

By declining unresolved expense requests after 30 days, OSC is able to avoid having many unresolved tickets pile up. This will help the OSC team avoid confusion, inaccurate financial reporting, and potential budgetary complications.

### Virtual Cards

Open Source Collective provides virtual cards to Collectives on request. Virtual cards act like credit cards and allow you to pay for expenses online using your Collective's balance.&#x20;

[Click here for more information about virtual cards.](../../what-we-offer/virtual-cards.md)

### Paying Upwork or Fiverr contractors

You can create a _reimbursement_ or use a _Virtual Card_ for payment to both of these services. Both [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/support/articles/360011135837-W-9-Collection?segment=seller) and [Upwork issue a 1099](https://support.upwork.com/hc/en-us/articles/211063958-Report-Income-from-Upwork) for their contractors/users. &#x20;

## Policies and Limitations

{% hint style="info" %}
Collective admins can[ set additional expense policies](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/expense-policy) to give guidance to expense submitters.
{% endhint %}

While we try to accommodate every request, we work within some limits defined by the IRS, human capacity of our staff, and technical limitations.

* OSC will only process payouts approved by an admin of the collective.
* All expenditures must be permitted under 501(c)(6) regulations.
* OSC cannot pay people in territories in the following sanctioned countries: Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic, Venezuela). In addition we may be unable to pay people in: Afghanistan, Burundi, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Republic of South Sudan, Yemen.
* OSC **only** makes payments via Paypal, bank transfers, and virtual cards.&#x20;
* We can't make direct payments via cashapp, venmo and similar services (because they don't allow nonprofits like OSC to sign up, among other reasons).
* Payouts must be broken down into individual expenses that detail what the money is spent on. We do not pay out undifferentiated chunks of money.
* We have certain paperwork requirements due to IRS rules and may need to collect W9 forms before we can pay someone. If this applies to you, we will let you know.
