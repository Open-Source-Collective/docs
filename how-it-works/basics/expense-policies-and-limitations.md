# Expense Policies and Limitations

While we try to accommodate every request, we work within some limits defined by the IRS, the human capacity of our staff, and technical limitations.

* OSC will only process payouts approved by an admin of the collective.
* All expenditures must be permitted under 501(c)(6) regulations.
* OSC cannot pay people in territories in the following sanctioned countries: Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic, Venezuela). In addition we may be unable to pay people in: Afghanistan, Burundi, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Republic of South Sudan, Yemen.
* OSC **only** makes payments via Paypal, bank transfers, and virtual cards.&#x20;
* We can't make direct payments via cashapp, venmo and similar services (because they don't allow nonprofits like OSC to sign up, among other reasons).
* Payouts must be broken down into individual expenses that detail what the money is spent on. We do not pay out undifferentiated chunks of money.
* Payment methods must be owned by the person(s) submitting a claim to be paid.&#x20;
* We have certain paperwork requirements due to IRS rules and may need to collect W9 forms before we can pay someone. If this applies to you, we will let you know.
* OSC limit PayPal expense payments to a maximum of $5,000 USD. For expenses larger than $5,000 USD, payments will be made by electronic bank transfer via Wise. This allows us to prevent potential risk and continue to protect our community and their financial assets.

Collective admins can[ set additional expense policies](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/expense-policy) to give guidance to expense submitters.

### Outstanding or Incomplete Expenses

The responsibility for ensuring payment completions lies with the collective and/or payee. In case of a payment error

* OSC will notify the collective and payee by commenting on the expense ticket and marking the ticket as 'incomplete.'
* Should payment still be required once the expense is marked as 'incomplete,' the collective and/or payee should edit the expense accordingly.
* If the collective and/or payee fails to respond and rectify the issue within 30 days, OSC will proceed to close the expense request. If payment is still required, the submitter should resubmit the expense request.&#x20;

By declining unresolved expense requests after 30 days, OSC is able to avoid having many unresolved tickets pile up. This will help the OSC team avoid confusion, inaccurate financial reporting, and potential budgetary complications.

To address pending 'error' payments predating 2023, OSC will make one final attempt to reach out and confirm the necessity of the payment. The expense will be closed if no response is received within 30 days.
