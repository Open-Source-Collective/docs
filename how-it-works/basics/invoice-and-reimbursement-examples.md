# Invoice and Reimbursement Examples

## Invoices&#x20;

[Invoices](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/submitting-expenses#invoices) should be used to pay individuals for work completed on behalf of the collective.

### Invoices must meet the following criteria to be paid:

* Must have a description of the work done, and the amount of time (normally in hours) spent on work.&#x20;
* The payee must include their billing address.
* The payee's name must match the billing contact.
* For any invoice over $5000USD:
  * the payee canâ€™t be the one who approved the expense (unless they are the sole admin) and;&#x20;
  * the payee must be a verified user or provide a form of banking integration.

Invoices need a clear description of services rendered and provide sufficient detail to make it clear what the collective is paying for.&#x20;

We may mark an invoice incomplete and follow up on invoices that just say "Payment" or which lack an explanation of the work performed.

#### Examples

You could include the detail of the work done in the description field of each line item.&#x20;

Or you can create one invoice for the total and attach your own invoice or time tracker to detail the work done. Here are examples of attachments.

## Reimbursements

Use[ reimbursements](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/submitting-expenses#reimbursements) to pay for purchases, donations, or subscriptions made on behalf of the collective.

Receipts are required so that we can ensure the requested amount matches the purchased amount in order to approve the reimbursement.

A **valid receipt** contains:

1. Name of the vendor (person or company you paid) &#x20;
2. Transaction date (when you paid) &#x20;
3. A detailed description of goods or services purchased (what you bought) &#x20;
4. Amount paid
5. The currency in question. This is normally clear from the address and the currency symbol. &#x20;
6. Form of payment (cash, check, or last four digits of the credit card)
